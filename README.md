# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

# Introduction to Data Science with Python Course

This is Introduction to Data Science with Python! This README serves as an overview of the course, which is the gateway to the Python and Data Science Specialization. Here's to find key information about the course structure, objectives, and why Python is the chosen language for this journey.

## Course Overview

This course is designed as the first step in a five-course specialization aimed at providing a comprehensive introduction to Data Science using Python. It's structured to build upon your knowledge progressively, enhancing your understanding and skills in Data Science.

### Who This Course Is For

- **Level**: Intermediate
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of programming and statistics
- **Focus**: Applied data science skills with Python

### Why Python?

1. **Ease of Learning**: Python's simplicity makes it the ideal language for beginners in programming, yet powerful enough for complex data science tasks.
2. **Full-Featured**: With extensive built-in libraries, Python excels in data manipulation, network programming, and database handling.
3. **Rich Data Science Libraries**: The course leverages Python's rich ecosystem, including the SciPy Ecosystem, Pandas, and Matplotlib, to teach practical data science skills.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four key modules:

1. **Python Basics**: An introduction or a refresher on Python programming, including advanced topics for those looking for an extra challenge.
2. **Pandas Toolkit**: Focuses on using pandas for data manipulation and analysis, drawing parallels to relational database concepts.
3. **Advanced Pandas**: Explores complex querying and manipulation techniques in pandas, essential for sophisticated data analysis.
4. **Course Project**: Applies the skills learned through a hands-on project involving data merging, cleaning, processing, and basic statistical analysis.

## Learning Resources

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The primary interface for coursework and assignments.
- **SciPy Stack**: Foundation for the course's main libraries, Pandas and Matplotlib.
- **Complementary Resources**: Access to books and online courses for deeper understanding and further learning.

## Conclusion

Through this course, we'll build a foundation in data science using Python, preparing you for more advanced topics in subsequent courses of the specialization.
