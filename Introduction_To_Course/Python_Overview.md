# Python Data Structures Overview

This guide provides an overview of Python's fundamental data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Understanding these data structures is crucial for effective data manipulation and algorithm development in Python.

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items (which can be of different types) and are one of the most versatile data structures in Python. They can be modified after their creation (mutable), allowing for operations like adding, removing, or changing items.

### Features:
- **Ordered:** The items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- **Mutable:** You can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
- **Allow duplicates:** Since lists are indexed, they can have items with the same value.

### Example:
```python
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.14]
print(my_list)


## Tuples

Tuples are similar to listis, but they are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. They are used to store collection of items in specific order.

### Features:
- **Ordered: ** The items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- **Immutable: ** Once a tuple is created, you cannot change, add, or remove items.
- **Allow duplicates: ** Tuples can also have items with the same value.
